# Introduction to IoT (ICampN 2025)
This repository contains source code that is part of the "Introduction to Internet of Things" materials from ICampN 2025, an event held by the ICN Laboratory at Universitas Brawijaya. 
This repository covers how to interface a microcontroller (i.e., ESP32) with sensors such as DHT, ultrasonic, and LDR; how to send the data through MQTT; and how to visualize it in Node-RED.
